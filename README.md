  - Arduino UNO (http://arduino.cc/en/Main/arduinoBoardUno)
  - Arduino Lilypad(http://arduino.cc/en/Main/arduinoBoardLilyPad)
  - Arduino Pro Mini (http://arduino.cc/en/Main/ArduinoBoardMini)
  
For any reference on programming, libraries and how to work with rFlea, use the previous Arduino boards as rFlea is 100% compatible with them or just check this list for compatibility (http://arduino.cc/en/Products.Compare). rFlea has a same lebeled pinout.
*you can program rFlea Arduino using the Arduino Pro Mini board, and its usual FTDI cable/board used in such a boards.

rFlea has ANT+ onboard, ANT+ is a ultra low power wireless tranceiver used in sports activities, sensor body networks and medical equipment. ANT+ allows very long lasting sensors with small coin batteries. With more information check http://www.thisisant.com/consumer/ant-101/what-is-ant
